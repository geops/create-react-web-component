#### Set up a React App wrapped in a Web Component
> This setup is is based on [*react-scripts*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) from [*create-react-app*](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)  
> A thorough description of the principles used in this setup, can be read [in this article](https://itnext.io/react-and-web-components-3e0fca98a593)
